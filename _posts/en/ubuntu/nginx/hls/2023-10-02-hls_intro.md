## What is HLS?

> HLS is a streaming technology developed by Apple.

HLS stands for ***"HTTP Live Streaming"*** and is a streaming protocol developed by Apple. HLS refers to a method of transmitting video and audio over the Internet. This technology splits the video into several smaller files (typically about 10 seconds long) and allows the video to be delivered in a variety of quality levels to suit the user's internet speed. As your internet speed speeds up or slows down, HLS automatically adjusts picture quality to provide the optimal streaming experience.

## Encode before streaming.

* HLS transmits video compressed using encoding technologies called H.264 and H.265.

* H.264 and H.265 are video compression standards. This technology, also called ***"Advanced Video Coding" (AVC)***, is used to reduce the size of video files while maintaining as much quality as possible. H.264 and H.265 are currently one of the most widely used video compression standards, primarily used to transmit high-quality video over the Internet or store it on digital devices.

## After encoding, the video data is fragmented.

1. The video is divided into segments that are a few seconds long. Segment lengths vary, but the default length is 6 seconds (until 2016 it was 10 seconds).

2. In addition to dividing the video into segments, HLS creates an index file of video segments to record the order of the segments.

3. HLS also replicates multiple sets of segments in different qualities, including 480p, 720p, and 1080p.

## How to do HLS streaming?

There are several ways to do HLS streaming.
From my knowledge, there are two main methods.

### Streaming service directly through a web server

  1. Install the Nginx web server.

  2. Set up HLS streaming using the Nginx RTMP Module.

  3. Segments video footage encoded in H.264 and H.265 into HLS format.

  3. Stream video.

### Serving through AWS S3 and CloudFront

  > S3 is AWS' file storage service and CloudFront is a CDN service.
  If you use the two services in conjunction, it is possible to distribute HLS format video files stored in S3 through CDN.

  1. Encode the video into H.264 and H.265 using FFMPEG or another encoding program.

  2. Segments the encoded file into HLS format.

  3. Save the directory where the segment file exists to the S3 bucket.

  4. Distribute the S3 bucket to CloudFront.

  5. HLS streaming is available through CloudFront.


I think you can just choose the method you want.

In Part 2, we will set up streaming using the Nginx RTMP Module.
